# Controller-Board
This is a kind of controller board with different peripherals that can be used in different applications. the goal of this board is to create a simple testbed for users that can easily use different peripherals of a microcontroller with just a primitive knowledge about Matlab and Labview. This board has a LAN interface that can easily communicate with a Labview or Matlab based UGI. these are all the peripherals of this board which is based on ARM LPC1768.
